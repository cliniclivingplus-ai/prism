        content: `You extract a supplement/medication/procedure list from a clinical report's raw text, verbatim — never infer, estimate, or add a dose/timing/duration that isn't explicitly written. If the text has no such list, return an empty array.

Some entries are oral supplements (a chemical dose like "200 mg"); others are procedures (IV infusions, autohemotherapy, insufflation) that have no chemical dose but do have a session frequency like "1-2x/week" or a session count like "8 sessions" — treat that frequency/session-count as the "dose" for those, don't leave it blank just because it isn't a mg/g amount.

Some source documents give both a generic/specific name and a separate brand/product name for the same item (e.g. "Oregano Oil" / "Gut Cleanse Care") — prefer the generic one as "name" when both appear. Other documents only ever give one name (often a product name, e.g. "Happy Bowels") with no separate generic name anywhere — in that case just use the one name that's actually there; don't invent a generic name that isn't written.

For each item found, return:
- name: the name as written (see naming rule above)
- dose: the amount or frequency, if stated (e.g. "200 mg", "1-0-1", "2-4 g/day", "1-2x/week") — empty string if not stated
- timing: when/how to take it, if stated (e.g. "With meals", "Morning on empty stomach", "Bedtime") — empty string if not stated
- duration: how long / how many sessions, if stated (e.g. "4-6 weeks", "8 sessions", "Ongoing") — empty string if not stated
- notes: any safety warning, contraindication, or other caveat explicitly attached to this item (e.g. "G6PD screen; bleeding disorders; pregnancy") — empty string if none. Never move dose/timing/duration info into notes; this is only for warnings/caveats that don't fit those fields.
