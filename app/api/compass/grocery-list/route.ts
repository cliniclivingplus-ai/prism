// The regex-based buildGroceryList() in src/lib/groceryList.ts already turns
// raw recipe ingredient lines into a candidate {name, category} list — fast,
// deterministic, and the instant fallback shown while this call is in
// flight. Sending its (already deduplicated, already shortened) output here
// instead of the raw ingredient lines keeps the prompt small and reliable.
// Some source PDFs had a two-column layout (ingredients beside directions)
// that the extractor read row-by-row, so a handful of candidates are really
// a whole instruction sentence with a real ingredient buried inside it
// (e.g. "Add cashew nuts and peanuts", "Pressure cook soaked chole until
// soft") rather than a clean ingredient name — this pass is also the one
// place that untangles those, pulling out just the real food name.

        content: `You are given a candidate grocery shopping list already extracted from a patient's recipes, one item per line as "name (category)". It has already had quantities/units/prep-instructions stripped, but may still contain: near-duplicates or synonyms of the same real ingredient worded differently ("garlic" and "garlic clove"), spelling variants ("chilli"/"chilly"), an item filed under the wrong category, or — because some source PDFs had ingredients and cooking directions in side-by-side columns that got merged during extraction — a whole instruction sentence with a real ingredient buried inside it (e.g. "Add cashew nuts and peanuts", "Pressure cook soaked chole until soft", "Cover the lid and simmer for 10 minutes").

Your jobs are to:
1. Merge entries that are clearly the same real-world ingredient into one (keep the clearer/shorter name).
2. Fix a category if it's clearly wrong.
3. If an entry reads like a cooking instruction (contains an imperative verb like add/cook/heat/simmer/mix/stir/garnish/pressure cook, or a time/quantity like "10 minutes", "3 whistles") rather than a plain ingredient name, pull out just the real food name(s) it mentions and output those instead (e.g. "Add cashew nuts and peanuts" → "Cashew nuts" and "Peanuts"). If it names no real food at all, drop it.
4. Drop an entry that is a vague back-reference rather than a specific food ("remaining vegetables", "the rest of the spices") — nothing to actually shop for.
5. Drop an entry that's a bare unit or nutrition-label word with no food attached — "water" (everyone has it, never a real shopping item), "powder" or "extract" alone (only a real product when paired with what it's made of, e.g. "protein powder" or "vanilla extract" — those stay), "kcal", "calories", "nutrition information".
6. Drop an entry only if it names no real food/ingredient at all — never drop a real ingredient just because it was phrased oddly or wrapped in instruction text.

Never invent an ingredient that isn't named somewhere in the input list — you may split one messy entry into the separate real ingredients it names, but you may not add anything not already present.
